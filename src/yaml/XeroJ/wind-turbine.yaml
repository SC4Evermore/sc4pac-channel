  summary: "Normal And Multirotor Wind Turbines by Xero_J"
  description: |-
   This file was created by Xero_J from Argentina.

   The installer contains the version animated and static of the wind turbines,if you want to remove one of the 2 versions
   enter the folder or document library go into "SimCity 4\Plugins\Xero_J\Normal and Multirotor Wind Turbines",
   you can remove the folder that you do not need (animated or static)
   the animated model has a small error in the largest zomm,sometimes shows bad animation,but it solves moving or rotating the camera a couple of times.

   These buildings have PIM-Xd statistics.

   To avoid conflicts, please, it is highly recommended to use any of the third party cleanitol tools and remove any previous versions from your plugins. In the ~Documents folder in the main ZIP you can find a **Cleanitol_Xero_J Normal and Multirotor Wind Turbines_Props.txt** file and by using either the newer nos.17's SC4 Cleanitol or the older BSC Cleanitol tool you can search and remove old and outdated versions of these files.
