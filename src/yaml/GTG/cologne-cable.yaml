  summary: "Cologne Cable by gottago(GTG)"
  description: |-
    Cologne Cable is a stage 5 CAMeLot 10x6 IM§§ Anchor, modeled on a large cable-storage facility erected in 1984 at the industrial complex of Carlswerk in Cologne-Mülheim, Germany. For non-CAM players, a ploppable version wih 843 IM§§ jobs will also be installed and will appear in your Landmarks menu. There is now a Stage 3 non-CAM growable added to the upload which offers 1012 IM$$ jobs. The BAT was created using 3DSMax 2010 and exported in Maxis-night version, and is modeled to scale—the actual building's footprint covers over 1½ soccer (football) fields. A prop pack containing HD cable spools and a scrapbin is also included in this package. This is a large lot to animate (23 empty tiles, to be exact), and the dreaded dependency list reflects that, but most should already be in your plugins folder.

    The Carlswerk has a rich history encapsulating the rise and fall of Western industry. Founded in 1874 by Franz Carl Guilleaume and incorporated as Felten & Guilleaume (F&G) soon after, the Carlswerk factory produced, among other things, wire, electric lines, and telephone and telegraph cable (the first transatlantic cable, laid in 1904, was manufactured there). Over time more production and storage buildings were added until, by the 1960s, some 23,000 people worked at the sprawling complex. In decline since the '70s, F&G changed ownership several times until it was eventually acquired by the Danish company NKT Cables. In 2007 NKT closed the Carlswerk and sold the property. The complex is currently being renovated as an upscale office park and apartment-loft complex and the CC building will doubtless be razed.

    To grow this lot, create a single 10x6 tile high-density IND lot by pressing the 'Ctrl' key when dragging your zone. Unless your city has a high unsatisfied IM demand, a large, stage 5 CAMeLot such as this will normally appear after several intermediate-stage lots have grown, and for the impatient among you, the aforementioned non-CAM Landmark plop will be available. Please note that sufficient IM demand must exist in your cities both to grow the lot and avoid abandonment of either version. 

    **INSTALLATION**

    Copy/Extract the GTG and/or CAM parent folders into your Plugins. If you've extracted the ~Documents folder you may remove it from the Plugins, but keep it in a safe location.
    *Bear in mind, that with the Project ZIP efforts the CAM (Colossus Addon Mod) related LOTs are having a dedicated folder for now on (see file paths below). If you don't want to use the non-CAM and/or PLOP versions of the lot, you can remove them from the GTG/Cologne Cable folder, but you must keep the GTG/Props folder as that contains the essential model files for all the LOTs.*
    
    To un-install the files, simply bulldoze every lot from this download in your cities and delete the files from the plugins folder afterwards.

    To avoid conflicts, please, it is highly recommended to use any of the third party cleanitol tools and remove any previous versions from your plugins. In the ~Documents folder in the main ZIP you can find a Cleanitol_GTG_Cologne_Cable.txt file and by using either the newer nos.17's SC4 Cleanitol or the older BSC Cleanitol tool you can search and remove old and outdated versions of these files.
