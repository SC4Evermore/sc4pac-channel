  summary: "VHS Building by gottago(GTG)"
  description: |-
    VHS is an abbreviation of Volkshochschule, or community college, in German. The original building stands on Cäcilienstraße at Neumarkt in Cologne, Germany. The unusual, banded entry facade is a bas-relief by the Italian sculptor Arnoldo Pomodoro.

    This was created to begin to fill a shortage of long, low-rise commercial buildings in SC4. Three versions of the lot will be installed a college, a growable 5x2 CO §§ stage 6, and a ploppable LM CO §§ with jobs (included as CO lots of these dimensions are difficult to grow).

    **INSTALLATION**

    Copy/Extract the GTG parent folder into your Plugins. If you've extracted the ~Documents folder you may remove it from the Plugins, but keep it in a safe location.

    To un-install the files, simply bulldoze every lot from this download in your cities and delete the files from the plugins folder afterwards.

    To avoid conflicts, please, it is highly recommended to use any of the third party cleanitol tools and remove any previous versions from your plugins. In the ~Documents folder in the main ZIP you can find cleantiol script and by using either the newer nos.17's SC4 Cleanitol or the older BSC Cleanitol tool you can search and remove old and outdated versions of these files.
