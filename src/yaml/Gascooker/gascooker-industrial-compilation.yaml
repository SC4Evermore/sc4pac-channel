  description: |
    The Friesian Foods Meat Packing Plant is a 4x3 dense industrial factory providing 358 I-D jobs with medium to high levels of air and water pollution. The plant is not just a mere abattoir but a self-contained "cow to packaged-ready-meal" production facility, which takes the MRM (mechanically recovered meat) process to a whole new level of efficiency. In fact, its patented hoof and eyelid extraction machines are so efficent that the cost of kebabs and ready-meal lasagnes have halved across Simnation.
    Friesian Foods has only ever experienced two reported outbreaks of Mad Cow Disease, and only one incident of the sim form: CJD (City Journal Diarrhoea syndrome). Its entirely safe to use but may affect nearby property price.
