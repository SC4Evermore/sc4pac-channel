  summary: Small timber frame shops Commercial Lot
  description: |
    This is a set of 10 small CS$ timber frame shops. Timber frame buildings are very common in Northern Europe. They were built in rural areas as well as big cities during the Middle Ages. This building style is generally found in areas with lots of woodlands and a large supply of timber. The main part of the construction is the wooden skeleton. This skeleton carries the loads of the building. The spaces between the wooden beams and columns are filled with plaster, brick, or stone.

  summary: The Green River Bar Commercial Lot
  description: |
    The Green River Bar is a small bar in an old timber frame building. The building was originally built in 1497, but was burned down in 1604 by angry citizens. The story goes that an old man brought prop pox to their city. As the city slowly disappeared the citizens became scared and angry. On a cold August night they surrounded the building and burned it to ashes, with the poor old man inside. In 1640 the building was reconstructed in its old style. Ever since it houses the Green River Bar, although no one understands where its name came from.
