Also, all the buildings are slope friendly for soft slopes.

  summary:  Ghetto Pack Residential Lot
  description: |
    This is a pack which contains 4 ghetto styled buildings. The buildings are based on real life buildings in the Bronx, New York. The buildings are six stories tall and have a small shop on street level. Behind the building there are two small gardens or some bare land.
    
    As building codes improved these buildings became slowly outdated and less popular. After the second World War white flight to the new suburbs and the construction of large and considerably cheaper public housing projects led to mass abandonedness in the Bronx. As owners saw their tenants and their income disappear they had no option but burning the building down to get some insurance money. In the 70th and 80th the Bronx looked more like a war zone than a residential neighborhood. Today urban renewal and renovation of these apartments has put back life in the bronx. Most of these buildings are now occupied by immigrants. 
    
    These kind of buildings can be found in many cities along the east cost of the USA. Some of the lots have 2 structures on it, while others have only 1 structure and some vacant space on it. All lots are CAMpatible, BTE enabled and slope friendly.

    This is a set of five low wealth apartment buildings. These kinds of buildings can be found in Dutch low wealth areas commonly. All five buildings are merged into a single building family and grow on a single stage 5 lot. Each building provides homes for up to 206 sims.

    This file is an updated version of the one I uploaded in July 2006 on Simtropolis. If you still have the old version there no need to delete it. Simply overwrite the old files with this one and you'll be fine. Keep in mind that this version has about two times as much residents. If you have a lot of these buildings from the older version in your city you will notice a increase of residents.

  description: |
    This is Jeff's house. During the credit crunch Jeff lost his job as a shop owner. For days he sat on the couch thinking how to make money during these financial difficult times. On his way to the local pub he heard a story of people getting rich with short selling. As a true American he saw the possibilities in it. After a few google searches he thought: 'let's give it a try'. Jeff opened an account at one of the hedge funds and started speculating on an economical crisis. In the begin he didn't earned much money, but after Jeff became more successful he started to take some bigger risks. It didn't take long before Jeff earned hundreds of dollars a day. With all the money he earned he decided to build the house of his dreams.

    Jeff's house grows on a 3x4 stage 1 lot and has a capacity of 15 R$$$ sims. The building is BTE enabled and is CAMpatible.

    This is the first pack of the JENX relotted series. In the past JENX made some very nice buildings, unfortunately his lots got outdated. and were poorly modded to today's standards. Therefore I've decided to relot his work and give the buildings new stats. This pack contains 25 lots with a selection of his German timber frame houses. All lot's are campatible and BTE enabled. The buildings range from stage 1 to stage 7 and are mostly R$$, however there also some R$ and R$$$ buildings.  Some of these lots are W2W. Have fun and I'll hope you like them.
