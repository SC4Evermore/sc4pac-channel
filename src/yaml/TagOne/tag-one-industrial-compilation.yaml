  summary: Expagra Industrial Lot
  description: |
    Expagra is a small company that produces expended graphite. Expanded graphite is made by immersing natural flake graphite in a bath of chromic acid, then concentrated sulfuric acid, which forces the crystal lattice planes apart, thus expanding the graphite. The expanded graphite can be used to make graphite foil or used directly as "hot top" compound to insulate molten metal in a ladle or red-hot steel ingots and decrease heat loss, or as firestops fitted around a fire door or in sheet metal collars surrounding plastic pipe (during a fire, the graphite expands and chars to resist fire penetration and spread), or to make high-performance gasket material for high-temperature use.

  summary: PCB Assembly Industrial Lot
  description: |
    There're hardly any products on the market that doesn't contain a printed circuit board inside it. From PC's and microwaves to those modern sound making postcards, they all contain at least one PCB. And all those PCB's are assembled somewhere. PCB Assembly is a factory for the assembly of those printed circuit boards in the Simnation. In this factory electronic compounds such as SMDs, resistors, LEDs and conductive pathways are added to pieces of plastic. As PCB's become smaller and smaller, most work is done by machines. Never the less, a lot of people are required to program and operate those machines. Therefore this factory proved up to 1153 I-ht jobs. The building grows on a 4x6 high density stage 6 lot.

  summary:  Tage Brickworks Industrial Lot
  description: |
    After years of designing ships and harbors Tage needed something new in his life. With his savings he decided to buy an old factory and start manufacturing bricks. The old factory wasn't designed as a brick factory so Tage had to do a lot of rebuilding. To get the large furnace and cooling equipment in the building he had to make four big temporary holes in the side of the building. The leftovers of the holes are still visible today as the stones are clearly cleaner over there. The building grows as and I-D stage 7 CAMeLOT and provides 1651 jobs.

  description: |
    Vester Acetone is a company that specializes in the production of acetone. Although the main focus of Vester Acetone is the production of acetone from benzene and propylene, a small amount of phenol is produced as well. In the reaction vats and distillation columns of the factory the benzene and propylene will first be compressed and heated to 250°C. This will form cumene. After this reaction the cumene will be oxidized and hydrolysed in an acidic medium to form phenol and acetone. The newly formed chemicals are then sold to other companies throughout the SimNation.

  description: |
    AquaFilter Inc is a small laboratory that develops high end filter equipment. The employees of this facility will research high tech membranes made of nano-parts for water purification, engine cleaning, oil and gas refinery and so on. The design of the building is eco-friendly. Thick insulated walls keep the heat in and small windows facing south keep the building cool in the summer. The large curtain wall facing north allows natural daylight to enter the building without heating it up due to direct sunlight. These features reduce the amount of energy required dramatically. The large area of solar panels on the roof produce the remaining energy required for the building to operate. The building is so energy efficient that it does not consume any power in your city.

    As it's a stage 2 building, AquaFilter Inc will probably be one of the first high tech industries that will settle in your city. The building is CAMpatible and provides 58 jobs.

  summary:  SAP Rebar Industrial Lot
  description: |
    Concrete is an interesting material. It can handle a lot of compression force, but hardly any puling force. In order to build concrete floors, walls and columns steel reinforcing bars need to be added to the concrete to handle the tension. Those steel bars are called rebar. On most construction sites the rebar is added by steel fixer. On some projects however it's cheaper and faster to pre-assemble the rebar cages and nets in a factory. SAP Rebar is such a factory. It grows on a 4x3 ID lot and provides 54 jobs. The building is BTE enabled and CAMpatible.
