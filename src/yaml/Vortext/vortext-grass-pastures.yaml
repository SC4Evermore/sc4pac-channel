  summary: Vortext - Grass Pastures
  description: |-
    This download contains eight (8) growable, stage 1 IR pastures. They're simple grass fields which do not contain a visible building. 
    The textures are in HD and multi-fsh; each texture contains no less than 16 variations of itself which will to a large extend eliminate tiling effects. 
    The package has been updated for Buidling Style DLL support.
