  description: |
    The Colossus Addon Mod (CAM) is a big mod that drastically changes the way cities and regions develop.
    Most importantly, it adds new Growth Stages 9 to 15, beyond the game's default Stages 1 through 8.
    This leads to extended and more realistic gameplay, especially for the later phases of the game.

    To make the most of CAM, you will need to install a variety of CAM-patible buildings for the higher Growth Stages.

    This package includes both Agricultural Demand Fix (I-R fix) and Modpack Zero.

    Please consult the extensive CAM documentation for further information.
